## Run + deploy

The frontend is built to be fully configurable and ready-to-go in under 10 minutes of dev time. Steps to customize and deploy:

1. Copy environment variables (`cp .env.sample .env.local`) and modify parameters
1. Then, `npm ci` (install dependencies) and `npm run dev` to run development build
